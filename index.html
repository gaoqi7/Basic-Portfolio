            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img src="assets/images/a-official.jpg" alt="Alisha's Portfolio Picture">
            <p>I’m Alisha.I love people; especially ones that give me massages, 
                peanut butter, and let me snooze in the sun. I have a favorite spot,
                 right behind my ears, that I like to get rubbed. When that happens,
                  I make a funny sound, because it feels so good! I get along with 
                  the dogs and people I have met here, including respectful children 
                  of all ages. I would rather not spend my time jogging or wrestling 
                  with energetic dogs since I’m a really mellow guy. I need a house
                   full of soft beds, people who like snuggles, and yummy treats!
            </p>

                I love swimming. I don't know where did I get this skill. I just can! My 
                first swim happens when I was three month old. For me, the best swimming 
                pool is the lake near my house. If no, a small muddy pond is acceptable. 
                there are always tons of fun waitting for me!
